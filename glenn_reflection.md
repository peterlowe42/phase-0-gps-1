# Eddie's reflection

## What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with some of the finer points of merging, sharing, and collaboration being supported by Git. The terminology is still tough for me to grasp or grow accustomed to, and I think that prevents me from feeling comfortable with the underlying concepts.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I now understand that a commit is a snapshot of a project's state at a certain time.

I better understand how the best practices of the commit requires imperative tenses (using "add" as opposed to "adding"), and how that is helpful when reviewing commits in the future.

It helped solidify my understanding of collaboration and the related commands. Especially how git pull breaks down into git fetch and git merge, how one person can push and/or open a pull request for a different person to review and accept.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

It's hard to remember them now, but I would often run into questions about the commands that I was using in the terminal as I was entering them.

## What still confuses you about git?

In terms of the basic commands used during the GPS, I don't know if those terms confuse me necessarily, that seems like too strong of a work. I think I understand them broadly enough to not feel "confused", but I don't yet feel confident when I use them, so I can carry out the work and follow the proper workflow but I'll want to frequently double check that I am following the right order of steps, or that I am following best practices.

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was good. It was hard to imagine how it would look because some of the introductory material made it sound more like the guide would be more like a teacher quizzing us, and othertimes the material made it sound like the guide would just silently observe. It ended up being somewhere in between.
