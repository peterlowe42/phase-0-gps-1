### Pete's Reflection

#**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

  I wasn't totally clear on what merging did but I think the main thing was that I didn't fully understand how git workflow would work with colaborators.

#**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

  It's certainly alot clearer now how working with others through github actally works. I now have a clear idea of how github would be used for real world colaborative projects. And why it is considered such a useful tool. 

#**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
   
  I asked how to add a colaborator and how view the files that had been changed in a pull request. 

#**What still confuses you about git?**
  
  I'm still not entirely clear on when or why I should merge branches on my own machine (or weather I should at all).  I do however understand how the merge process works on github. 

#**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

   It was suprisingly fun I'm looking forward to the next one.
